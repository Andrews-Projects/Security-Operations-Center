# Security operations Center Implementation

## Introduction

This project aims to implement various aspects of a security operations center,tools used & methodologies using various open source technologies.This is simply my form of project based learning.

### Implementations will include:

1. Intrusion prevention & detection with Snort.
2. Vulnerability Scanner (OpenVAS).
3. Network monitoring with Zabbix & bandwidth monitoring.
4. Maltego.
5. Firewall:
- Bandwidth control and monitoring.
- Web filtering.
- Internet aggregation and SD WAN.
- Logging.
- Sandboxing.
- Deep Packet Inspection.

To achieve practically I will have to set-up several virtual machines that will be act as independent servers.

Ubuntu server will be the logical choice because of its lightweight minimum requirments:
- RAM: 512MB. 

- CPU: 1 GHz.

- Storage: 1 GB disk space (1.75 GB for all features to be installed)
