# Security operations Center Implementation

## Introduction

This project aims to implement various aspects of a security operations center,tools used & methodologies using various open source technologies.This is simply my form of project based learning.

The main functions of a SOC are as follow:
- Take Stock of Available Resources.
- Preparation and Preventative Maintenance.
- Continuous Proactive Monitoring.
- Alert Ranking and Management.
- Threat response.
- Recovery and Remediation
- Log Management

### Implementations will include:

1. Intrusion prevention & detection with Snort & ELK Stack for Log monitoring.
2. Vulnerability Scanner (OpenVAS).
3. Network monitoring with Nagios. ----> Done.
4. Maltego.
5. Firewall:
- Bandwidth control and monitoring.
- Web filtering.
- Internet aggregation and SD WAN.
- Logging.
- Sandboxing.
- Deep Packet Inspection.

To achieve practically I will have to set-up several virtual machines that will be act as independent servers.

Ubuntu server will be the logical choice because of its lightweight minimum requirments:
- RAM: 512MB. 

- CPU: 1 GHz.

- Storage: 1 GB disk space (1.75 GB for all features to be installed)
